ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anna. Here are somethings you should know about me:

- I am a data scientist and analyst with over three years of experience leveraging advanced analytics to drive social impact.
- I am proficient in Python, SQL, and Tableau, with a proven record of developing predictive models and dashboards to support strategic decision-making.
- I am deeply passionate about harnessing data to advance equity and justice.
- I recently earned a Masterâ€™s in Advanced Data Science from Syracuse University, graduating with a 4.0 GPA.
- I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the University of Washington - Seattle.
- My professional journey spans a broad range of experiences, driven by my interests in both politics and engineering/data.
- During my undergraduate years (and continuing to this day), I have worked alongside a Civil Rights Lawyer, applying my data skills to analyze hundreds of pages of discovery materials.
- I also had the opportunity to directly advocate for clientsâ€”managing a caseload of over 15 individualsâ€”drafting briefs, appeals, and other legal documents to fight on their behalf.
- After completing my Bachelorâ€™s, I joined Boeingâ€™s Digital Integration Team, where I built a SQL server from the ground up and deployed automated Python jobs to streamline and replace manual processes.
- Following these experiences, I currently serve as a Data Analyst at the economically progressive non-profit WorkMoney. There, I perform micro-segmentation analysis to help engage and support our community of 8+ million members.

As you can see, I am a jack of all trades. :)

With experience across both the technical and legal fields, I aspire to be someone who helps bridge the gap between these two worlds. Data is a powerful tool for storytellingâ€”one that our policymakers must embrace.Not only is the influence of data increasingly undeniable, but the need for a technology-forward policy agenda is absolutely essential. These two domainsâ€”technology and policyâ€”are deeply interconnected. If they are not working in concert, they risk undermining one another and, ultimately, harming the very communities they aim to serve. Access to technology is a fundamental right, one we must prioritize if we hope to foster greater equity and justice in our society. And letâ€™s be honestâ€”who doesnâ€™t love the internet? =)
